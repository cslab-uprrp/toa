Toa
===

Toa is a web based NetFlow data network monitoring system (NMS). Toa consists of a collection of scripts that automatically parse NetFlow data, store this information in a database system, and generate interactive line charts for network visualization analytics. The system is pseudo real time, meaning that it continuously updates the interactive charts from NetFlow data that is generated every five minutes. Toa also provides an interface to generate customized charts from the data stored in the database, and plugins that connect the visualization charts with the NetFlow data file for more in depth visualizations and analysis.
